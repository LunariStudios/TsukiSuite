TsukiSuit is an open source, free for commercial use group of libraries created for making Unity Development more pleasant.    

Each library can be compared as a version of Google's [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava), but created for Unity  

Currently, only three of those exists, but more will be added as the need for them surface
* Tsuki Runtime _(Core libraries)_  
* Tsuki Editor _(Editor specific libraries)_
* Tsuki Graphs _([Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) libraries)_
## Features and examples
*  Collections
    ```csharp
    List<int> list = new List<int>();
    if (list.IsEmpty()) {
        Debug.Log("Is empty!");
    }
    ```
    ```csharp
    public struct Data {
        public string Name;
        public int Priority;
    }
    
    List<Data> data = PopulateListWithRandomData();
    Data withHighestPriority = data.MaxBy(d => d.Priority)
    ```
* Colors
    ```csharp
    Color color = Colors.RandomColor();
    Color newColor = color.SetHue(Mathf.Sin(Time.time));
    ```
    ```csharp
    Color a = new Color(1, 0, 1, 1);
    ColorHSV b = a;
    ColorHSV colorHSV = new ColorHSV(0, 1, 1, 1);
    Color c = colorHSV;
    ```
* Editor
    ```csharp
    // Bonus: A list of hidden UnityEditor GUIStyles!
    var style = GUIStyles.Get(GUIStyles.box);
    var labelRect = position.GetLine(2); 
    EditorGUI.LabelField(labelRect, "I am on the third with the console info style!", style);
    ```
* UI
    ```csharp
    // No need to declare a copy of Graphic.color
    Text.SetAlpha(Mathf.Sin(Time.time));
    Text.SetHue(Mathf.Cos(Time.time));
    ```
* And many more
## Building
This project is written with C# 7 and compiles to .NET 3.5, for backwards compatibility,
so make sure your compiler is able to meet these two requirements.  
Make sure you have these components installed via Visual Studio installer:
* NET 4.+ SDK & Targeting Pack
* NuGet package manager
* C# and Visual Basic Roslyn compilers
## Planned features
* Code Generation tool using T4 templates.
* Best practices knowledge base and bad practice detection.
